        "D. Service-oriented architecture",
        "Micro Channel architecture is a specification for peripherals to interact with hardware systems that was proposed and implemented by IBM in the 1990s. Service-oriented architecture is an older concept that has been revived, to a degree, by microservices. The other answers are not things that exist."

        "C. Serverless",
        "Infrastructure as a service is a cloud-based offering where companies may just acquire servers they can use for their infrastructure. Service oriented is a way of potentially designing applications. Everything in AWS is virtualized. This leaves serverless. Lambda functions don't require the provisioning of servers to support them. All processing of the function and its data is handled by AWS infrastructure."

        "Emulation is where applications may be run on a processor they were not compiled for so the operation codes are emulated. AWS is Amazon Web Services, which can offer application virtualization services but is not a type of application virtualization. Paravirtualization is partial virtualization. Containers are a way of isolating applications without using full virtual machines on a hypervisor."

        "Commonly, you will see the following in an n-tier application design as core features: browser, application server, database server. There may also be security functions and load balancers as well as a web server in front of the application server. When you focus just on the core, though, the application server is in the middle of the architecture."
